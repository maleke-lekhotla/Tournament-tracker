## Tournament-tracker
### Repository for the tournament tracker in am building in C#
My friends and I like to play small tournaments. such as pool tournaments, video games and so on. 

We want to be able to track our torunaments using an application that creates mathups, schedules
matches and tracks all the winners. The tournaments are single elimination games.
